Hi!

I am Monika. This blog is the log dump of my thought process generated in a semi-automated fashion.

Prior to joining IBM Research, I was a PhD Scholar at IIIT Delhi working with Software Engineering group. My work was at the intersection of Machine Learning, Mining Software Repositories, Business Intelligence and Process Mining. I performed process mining from multiple perspectives on data stored in software repositories for identification of inefficiencies, imperfections, organizational analysis and better process management. Thereafter, provided automated preventive machine learning based solutions.
